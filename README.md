Harmonia
========

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/kurisuwhyte/harmonia.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kurisuwhyte/harmonia)

Harmonia is an expressive statically typed language, for writing better and
safer web applications. It heavily borrows from Smalltalk, Scala, Haskell and
Scheme, and compiles down to plain JavaScript.

Do note that the language is not compatible with JavaScript, but we have an FFI
for that ;)

> Please note that the language is still in early alpha stages so PLEASE PLEASE
> PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T USE IT FOR PRODUCTION YET else Little Chris
